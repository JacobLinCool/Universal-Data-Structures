## Guidelines

1. Each line of code should be less than 100 characters, less than 80 is recommended.
2. Readability matters, don't over-use abbreviations.
3. Naming convension:
    - never use `camelCase`, use `UPPER_CASE`, `snake_case` and `PascalCase` instead.
    - for constant-like things, use `UPPER_CASE`.
    - for class-like things, use `PascalCase`.
    - for other things, use `snake_case`.
    - don't name macros with `snake_case`.
    - use `_` as prefix for macro arguments.
